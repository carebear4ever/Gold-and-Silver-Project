# Gold-and-Silver-Project 
This project is about gold and silver prices also comparing their prices to the S&P 500 prices over the last 10 years. I newly have found an interest in wearing and making jewlery and I have just recently started to dive into the stock market world. Mostly all of my jewlery is gold and silver. Questions I was curious about were which is most expensive, which would I want to invest in, do they have any trends/correlations that stood out, and price performance. Gold has a higher price than silver because it's rarer, but S&P 500 has the highest price. In 2015 both gold and silver prices dropped to their lowest and both went back up. Gold's price is at it's highest in 2022 and silver was at it's highest in 2012. Right now gold and S&P 500 prices are over 1,000.00.
